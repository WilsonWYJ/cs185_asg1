                Hi! My name is Yujie Wang. I am a second year Computer Science major student at UCSB. I came from Xiamen (Amoy), a small island located in southeast China. My hobbies include listening to music (especially Cantonese songs), watching movies, and travelling. Iâ€™ve been to most of provinces in China and 6 states in the US, and I am looking forward to exploring more! Nice to meet you all!
